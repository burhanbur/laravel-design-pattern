# Introduction
Implementation of the Service-Repository Design Pattern using Laravel framework. Service-Repository is a design pattern that separates the logic from the controller, so that it can be used again without having to rewrite the same logic.

By applying the DRY (_Don't repeat yourself_) principle, you can write program code more efficiently
